1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,560
I met Mack

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,399
set a laundromat

3
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:02,000
because he tried

4
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,919
to rescue my

5
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:03,740
pink sock from

6
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,179
eternal spin-cycle doom.

7
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,139
We started texting

8
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,099
memes and dumb

9
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,240
TikTok trends back

10
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,500
and forth, then

11
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,250
hooking up between

12
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,460
half-folded sheets and

13
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,500
pizza boxes. I

14
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,119
swore he was

15
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,359
different, not just

16
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,879
another smooth-talking charmer,

17
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,920
until I found

18
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,399
out he and

19
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,280
my roommate, Tiff,

20
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,000
had been DMing

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,920
heart emojis behind

22
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,699
my back. When

23
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,179
I caught them

24
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,039
swapping more than

25
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,059
detergent, I posted

26
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,019
screenshots of their

27
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,059
cringe messages to

28
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:28,699
our group chat

29
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:29,379
with the caption,

30
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:30,500
dirty laundry, but

31
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,120
make it public.

32
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,179
Tiff moved out,

33
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,640
Mack's ghosted everyone,

34
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,539
and the building

35
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:36,500
called me Queen

36
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,000
of the Spin

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,740
Cycle for a

38
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,259
week. Now I

39
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:39,780
do my laundry

40
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,399
in peace. And

41
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,740
my socks? They

42
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,600
never go missing.
