Okay, so picture this: it’s a Thursday night, and I’m completely trashed at this college party, right? My friend dares me to text my crush something crazy, and I’m like, "why not?" So, I text him, "Hey, can’t stop thinking about your dog’s Instagram 🐕." I wake up the next morning with zero memory and a cringey response from him: "I don’t have a dog, but wanna grab coffee?" I cringe so hard, but think, "Maybe this could work?" I show up to coffee, and guess what? His twin brother happens to own a dog-dedicated account, and yep, they swapped phones last night. Talk about swapping places! Now I’m sitting there dining with a dude who's annoyed at the mix-up but surprisingly interested! How did that happen?!
