33
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:17,960
stop thinking

34
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,199
about

35
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:18,719

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,539
with

41
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:21,800
zero

42
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,120
memory

43
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:22,440
and

44
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,920
a cringy

45
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,179
response

46
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:23,460
from

47
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:23,660
him

48
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,699
I don't

49
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:24,920
have a

50
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,160
dog

51
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,480
but want

52
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:25,719
to grab

53
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:26,059
coffee

54
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:27,579
I cringe

55
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:27,859
so

56
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:28,120
hard

57
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,539
but think

58
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,420
maybe

59
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,620
this

60
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:29,980
could work

61
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,480
I show

62
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,699

63
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:31,960

64
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,200
and

65
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,600
guess what

66
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:33,719
His twin

67
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,000
brother

68
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,320
happens

69
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,539
to

70
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:34,840
own a

71
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,420
dog dedicated

72
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:35,859
account

73
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,460
and yep

74
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,359
they swapped

75
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:37,619
phones

76
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:37,899

Talk

79
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:39,820
about swapping

80
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,179
places

81
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,780
Now I'm

82
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,200
sitting there

83
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,439
dining

84
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:42,659
with

85
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,000
a dude

86
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,259

87
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:43,500
annoyed

88
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:43,759
at the

89
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,140
mix-up

90
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,820
but surprisingly

91
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,299
interested

92
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:46,479
How

93
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:46,740

94
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,100
