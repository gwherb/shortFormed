00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,839
I met Mack set a laundromat because he tried to rescue my pink sock from eternal spin-cycle

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,520
doom.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,320
We started texting memes and dumb TikTok trends back and forth, then hooking up between

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,400
half-folded sheets and pizza boxes.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,440
I swore he was different, not just another smooth-talking charmer, until I found out he and

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,719
my roommate, Tiff, had been DMing heart emojis behind my back.

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,920
When I caught them swapping more than detergent, I posted screenshots of their cringe messages

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,520
to our group chat with the caption, dirty laundry, but make it public.

Tiff moved out, Mack's ghosted everyone, and the building called me Queen of the Spin

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,120
Cycle for a week.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,400
Now I do my laundry in peace.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,679
And my socks?

13
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,840
They never go missing.
